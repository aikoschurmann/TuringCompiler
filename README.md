# Turing Machine Compiler

The **Turing Machine Compiler** is a tool designed to compile high-level Turing Machine descriptions into executable code that can be run on a Turing Machine simulator or a physical Turing Machine.

## Features

- **High-level Language**: Write Turing Machine descriptions using a high-level, human-readable language.
- **Compiler**: Compile Turing Machine descriptions into machine-readable code for execution.
- **Simulator Integration**: Integrate with Turing Machine simulators for testing and debugging.
- **Optimization**: Apply optimizations to generated code for improved performance.
- **Cross-platform**: Supports multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/example/turing-machine-compiler.git
    ```

2. Build the compiler using your preferred build tool (e.g., Cargo for Rust projects).

### Usage

To compile a Turing Machine description file, use the following command:

```bash
tmc compile <input-file> <output-file>
