# Turing Machine Compiler

The **Turing Machine Compiler** is a tool designed to compile high-level Turing Machine descriptions into executable code that can be run on a Turing Machine simulator or a physical Turing Machine.

## Features

- **High-level Language**: generate Turing Machine instructions using a high-level, human-readable language.
- **Compiler**: Compile codes into machine-readable code for execution.
- **Simulator Integration**: Integrate with Turing Machine simulators for testing and debugging.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/example/turing-machine-compiler.git](https://github.com/aikoschurmann/TuringCompiler
    ```

2. Build the compiler using your preferred build tool (e.g., Cargo).
